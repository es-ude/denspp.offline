"simple_model.py" implements an external current source. However, this could not work due to a bug in the NgSpice simulator
(https://github.com/PySpice-org/PySpice/issues/255). 
It is fixed in a later NgSpice version (https://sourceforge.net/u/thejackal360/ngspice/ci/276a456659aa276a30140b59eff39ececdaaadb1/) 
which is unfortunately not supported by PySpice as of version 1.5. It should be resolved in PySpice version 1.6. Otherwise 
the workaround below would be of use.

Workaround (for Windows):
1. Install the PySpice package as per the instructions:
   a. pip install pyspice
   b. pyspice-post-installation --install-ngspice-dll
   c. pyspice-post-installation --check--install

2. Download the tar.gz file of NgSpice version 34: 
   (https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ng-spice-rework/old-releases/34/ngspice-34.tar.gz/download)

3. Unzip

4. In "ngspice-34\src\spicelib\devices\isrc\isrc.c" source code, edit line 30:
   Old: IOP ("external", ISRC_EXTERNAL, IF_REALVEC,"external source description"),
   New: IOP ("external", ISRC_EXTERNAL, IF_STRING,"external source description"),
   (based on https://sourceforge.net/u/thejackal360/ngspice/ci/276a456659aa276a30140b59eff39ececdaaadb1/)

5. Build project "ngspice-34\visualc\sharedspice.vcxproj" in Visual Studio 2022 with the Release x64 option
   (see Section 19.1.3 of NgSpice user manual)

6. Copy "ngspice-34\visualc\sharedspice\Release.x64\ngspice.dll"

7. In PySpice package location, go to "Spice\NgSpice\Spice64_dll\dll-vs" and replace both "ngspice.dll" and "ngspice-34.dll"
   with the file copied in step 6, renaming where necessary.
