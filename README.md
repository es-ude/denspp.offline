# MERCUR Sp:AI:ke-Project
In this project the matlab and python code for the MERCUR Sp:Ai:ke-Project is stored.

## Getting started
The software framework will be used to optimise the spike sorting pipeline for the integration in embedded systems und in ASICs for future neural implants. For this, the following software is required:
- MATLAB R2022a from The Mathworks
- Additional MATLAB Toolboxs: Fuzzy Logic, Communications, ParallelComputing 
- Python Interpreter (Version 3.9)

It is recommended that each working group will create a new branch for editing their input. At the end of each project, their input will be merged with the main branch. Further informations about this software framework are described in the PPTX/PDF-Documentation.

The 2_data folder has only a subset of the data. To get access to all the available datasets get in Contact with Leo Buron.

## Installation
To use the software framework locally, please use the GitHub Desktop Software to clone the desired branch of this repository to your personal computer. A detailed description is available at this [homepage](https://www.devopszones.com/2020/08/how-to-use-github-desktop-with-gitlab.html).

## Usage
For starting the software framework in your branch, please start MATLAB script "main.m". Further functions and classes are outsourced into the folder "Functions".
The script "labeling.m" is still work in progress and will be able to label unlabeled datasets.
